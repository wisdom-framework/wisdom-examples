This is a repository of examples for the OSGi based Wisdom Framework.

## Wisdom Framework

Wisdom is a lightweight framework enforcing a stateless, web-friendly architecture. Itâ€™s modular, and dynamic.

Wisdom is based on the NIO and asynchronous framework VertX. It is integrally built on top of OSGi, to enable modularity, and iPOJO, to make dynamism easy as pie.

With Wisdom, you web application is not monolithic anymore, but divided into a set of components deployable on the fly, and enabled / disabled dynamically, remotely or locally.
